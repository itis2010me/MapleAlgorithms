# MapleAlgorithms
Some algorithms for solving robotics problems that I implemented. 

Mathematical foundations taken from 'Ideals, Varieties, and Algorithms (4th ed.)' Chapter 1-6

All the `.mw` files requires Maple(version 2020 or later) to run.
There are:

- GCD calculation
- Multivariate polynomial division
- BuchBurger Algorithm(for producing Groebner basis in the base form)
